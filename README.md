# Lockpicking Minigame
### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/lockpickingminigame/#/)

Lockpicking Minigame is browser-based replica of the standard lockpicking minigame found within many video games. The design itself was taken from Skyrim however the underlying animations and setup could be re-skinned to look like other games or to a new and unique aesthetic.

This minigame was designed with VueJs so it can be easily used within S&Box when the game releases. Although there currently is no win or lose condition, it's designed to be easily modified to different controls, difficulties, and mechanics. Once S&Box releases they will be implemented with the C# layer provided by the game rather than continuing with JavaScript for the logic.
